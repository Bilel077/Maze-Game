# Maze Game with BFS and DFS Algorithms 

This project is an interactive maze game implemented in Python, featuring maze generation and pathfinding using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms. 

# Features 

Interactive gameplay where the user navigates through mazes. 

###### Maze generation:

Randomly generated mazes. 

Manually designed mazes.

###### Pathfinding algorithms: 

Breadth-First Search (BFS) for finding the shortest path. 

Depth-First Search (DFS) for pathfinding exploration.
